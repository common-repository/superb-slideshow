This is a strong, cross browser fade in slideshow script that incorporates some of your most requested features all rolled into one. Each instance of a fade in slideshow on the page is completely independent of the other, with support for different features selectively enabled for each slideshow.

There is big change in the plugin version 12.0, from this version onwards, images are loading from folder. Please check the plugin admin to change the folder. also please note that change in short code.

*   Fade in effect that has the current image fading over the previous one.            
*   Automatic slideshow.             
*   Slideshow can be set to stop rotating after N cycles.        
*   Each slide can be optionally hyperlinked.    
*   Each slide can have an optional description associated with it.     
*   Descriptions can either be set to show on demand (when the mouse rolls over the slide), or be always visible until explicitly dismissed.    
*   Persistence of last viewed slide supported, so when the user reloads the page, the slideshow resumes from the last slide.        
*   Slideshow automatically pauses onMouseover.
